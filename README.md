   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Deploy!

#### 2. Static Hosting

You can deploy the `dist` directory to any static hosting service:

- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages
- Any static file hosting

### Post-Deployment

After deployment:

1. Verify PWA functionality
2. Test offline capabilities
3. Confirm file upload and preview features
4. Check dark mode switching
5. Test math equation rendering
6. Test on different devices and browsers

## Usage

1. **Upload Files**
   - Drag and drop markdown files onto the upload area
   - Click the upload area to select files
   - Only `.md` files are supported

2. **View Files**
   - Click on a file in the sidebar to view its contents
   - Content is automatically rendered as HTML
   - Code blocks are syntax highlighted
   - Images and links are supported
   - Math equations are rendered using KaTeX

3. **Dark Mode**
   - Toggle dark mode using the sun/moon icon
   - Preference is saved locally
   - Optimized contrast for better readability
   - Math equations adapt to dark theme

4. **Offline Usage**
   - Install the PWA when prompted
   - Files viewed while online will be available offline
   - Changes are synchronized when back online

5. **Math Equations**
   - Supports inline math using single `$` delimiters
   - Supports display math using double `$$` delimiters
   - Example inline: $E = mc^2$
   - Example display:
     $$
     \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     $$
